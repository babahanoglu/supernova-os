# Documentation

## Audience and placement

- `docs/` is for people using Supernova: setup, configuration, compatibility, workflows, and limitations. Keep contributor tooling and implementation details out of these guides.
- `docs/internal/` is for developers and coding agents building Supernova: conventions, cross-package constraints, architectural decisions, and development/release procedures.
- `docs/assets/` holds assets used by user-facing documentation.
- The root `AGENTS.md` is the only agent instruction entry point. Keep it short and link to internal guidance by task. Do not add package-level `AGENTS.md` files or duplicate rules in skills.

Product direction belongs in the internal product guide; shipped usage belongs in user guides. A document being readable by users does not make it a user guide.

## What to write

Record what a contributor would otherwise get wrong: ownership boundaries, decisions and their reasons, failure guarantees, and conventions not enforced by tools. Keep local implementation explanations in nearby code comments. Link to code rather than copying types, methods, or control flow into prose.

For user guides, explain how to accomplish a task and what limitations affect it. Avoid cataloging visible buttons or describing every UI state.

## How to maintain it

- Give each subject one home. Link from related pages instead of repeating the same rules.
- Rewrite the affected section when behavior changes. Don't append task summaries or a second account of the same behavior.
- Keep durable guidance separate from temporary plans, research notes, and work logs.
- When adding a page, link it from the appropriate documentation index. Add a task link in `AGENTS.md` when agents need it to find a convention or constraint.
- When moving a page, update incoming links and check its relative links. Do not leave duplicate copies at old paths.

## Voice

Use plain, short sentences. Address the reader directly. State the rule, then explain the reason only when it adds information. Match the page you are editing; avoid slogans, emphatic repetition, and claims like “seamless” or “powerful.”
